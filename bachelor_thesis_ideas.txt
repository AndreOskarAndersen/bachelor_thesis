* Identifying areas of improvement in sport
* Using DS and Machine learning for finding the optimal soccer team (or another sport)
* Play the coach of a sports team and use DS and ML to improving the team (both tactics and player picks. For instance in CSGO; I could pick Astralis as my team, then I will use DS and ML to decide which maps to pick, which team members to (potentially) swap for other players...)
