# Title
 1. Explaining/Interpreting single-human 2D articulated pose estimation
 2. Single-human 2D articulated pose estimation with interpretation of the model/blackbox
 3. Interpreting the black boxbox of songle-human 2d articulated human pose
 4. Estimating the pose of a human with explainable artificial intelligence
 5. Single-human 2D articulated pose estimation using explainable artificial intelligence

# Problem
The task of this project is to create a model, which does 2D estimation of the pose of a single articulated human body in an image. This will be done firstly, by collecting, cleaning and explore a suitable dataset. Next, multiple models will be created and evaluated to find a optimal solution to the task. Lastly, the project will explore and evaluate what the final model has learned and use this to improve the understanding of the model.

# Motivation
Human pose estimation is widely used in the world of technology today, where huge, complex models analyse data to estimate the pose of humans. However, as the complexity of these models has increased, the models have started to work more and more as a "black box", where it can be difficult to understand how the models work and why they work as they do. The motivation for this thesis is to explore, recreate and evaluate such models and to explain how they work and why they work as they do. 

# Connection of the project to the field of computer science
Computer science is the study of computer systems and how they can be used. This project will use the power of a computer system to store, explore and analyse data, hence why the project presents an instance of how computer systems can be used on data.

# The dataset
This project will make use of the 2017 COCO-keypoints dataset. The dataset contains pictures of people during various tasks, which have all been labeled with keypoints. The dataset is split into training, validation and a testing sets, however, the test set does not contain keypoint annotations, hence will not be used for this thesis. The training set is about 18 GB and contains about 118.000 images, where the validation set is about 1 GB and contains about 5.000 images.

# Learning outcome
By carrying out this project I will learn about different deep neural network architecture, how they work and which applications they apply to. Next, I will learn about the preprocessing and analysis of images as data. Lastly, I will learn about the concept of "explainable artificial intelligence" and how this can be used to improve the understanding of the developed model.
