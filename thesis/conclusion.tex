\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion} 
We have succefully implemented and trained a stacked hourglass, developed by Newell \textit{et al.} \cite{Newell}, consisting of a single hourglass. The network was trained and validated on the Microsoft COCO dataset \cite{COCO_article}. We have then interpreted the model by $(1)$ verifying the effects of some of the parts of the model, $(2)$ finding the effects of the principal components of the latent space of the model, and $(3)$ found the effects of the clusters of the latent space of the model. By doing so we have gained an understanding of how the model works, found redundancy in the model, as well as found reasons for the models inaccuracies. Lastly, we used our knowledge of the model to succefully improve the performance of the developed model.
